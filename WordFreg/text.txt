Initialize the dA class by specifying the number of visible units (the
        dimension d of the input ), the number of hidden units ( the dimension
        d' of the latent or hidden space ) and the corruption level. The
        constructor also receives symbolic variables for the input, weights and
        bias. Such a symbolic variables are useful when, for example the input
        is the result of some computations, or when weights are shared between
        the dA and an MLP layer. When dealing with SdAs this always happens,
        the dA on layer 2 gets as input the output of the dA on layer 1,
        and the weights of the dA are used in the second stage of training
        to construct an MLP.
